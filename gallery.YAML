  This project simulates a game of Mahjong, allowing users to play with other players 
  in a local multiplayer mode. The interface will display a standard Mahjong table, 
  including player hands, the wall, discarded tiles, and bets. Players will be able to 
  draw, discard, call tiles (chi, pon, kan), and declare winning hands according to 
  standard Mahjong rules. The game will enforce legal moves and provide basic rule 
  validation.
